The rabbit hole

You've heard of the Fanta$tic 5 but how about the Majestic 5. Make your way through the rabbit whole and find the creator.

#### Points: 75

We are given a shortened link, which when opened brings us to a Google Sites clone of the Osmosis Institute's website. Comparing against the real site, there are two buttons here that say "Back to Safety" and "Dig in the rabbit hole." Upon clicking on "Dig in the rabbit hole," we get redirected to the sponsors page of OSMOSISCon. Looking at the challenge description, I googled "Majestic 5" and saw that it's a product from one of the sponsors, which is also the flag.
