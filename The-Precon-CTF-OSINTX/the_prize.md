#### Points: 70

We are given a photo of someone showing two rings, one 2011 and the other 2014. Using Google Lens on the ring shows us that it's a Cheerleading World Championships ring. The Wikipedia page for [The Cheerleading Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cheerleading_Worlds) shows the winner of both 2011 and 2014 - `Bangkok University Cheerleading Team`.
